## TypeScript Demo

This repository contains sample code, PowerPoint, and documentation for my TypeScript presentation. It includes the before and after code.

### Presentation Abstract

Have you ever wanted to have statically typed classes in JavaScript while at the same time being able to still enjoy some of the dynamic aspects of the JavaScript language? Have you ever wanted to be able to structure your teamâ€™s large JavaScript application code into dynamically loadable modules? Have you ever wanted richer tooling for JavaScript that is closer to what you experience with C# tooling? If you answered YES to these questions, then this is the presentation for you. This demo-heavy session will show numerous features that allow you to quickly and easily write JavaScript code that will run in any browser, host, or OS!
